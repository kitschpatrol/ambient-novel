				"We sit here together on low, sturdy, mahogany deck chairs, taking inventory of the scene. There‚Äôs the silent still water of the illuminated swimming pool. The night sky is a dotted blur of normal <span style=\"color: #000000;\">black</span>. The unfamiliar landscaping trails off in the dark like a giant sleepwalking cat. The warm subtle breeze is three notches into the realm of perceptible.",
				"It‚Äôs our new rental. We‚Äôll be here for eight weeks and this is the first hour.",
				"We take deep breaths without speaking any words.",
				"After three balmy days of driving we both feel the remains of a recent adrenaline spike, after all, we finally arrived. But, exhaustion will win out shortly and if we don‚Äôt fall asleep here in this recline we‚Äôll pull ourselves together and drift away into separate beds.",
				"There will be time for effortless backstrokes in this pool now before us.",
				"And, if we feel like it, maybe we will explore the contours of what seems to be a well-manicured backyard. Or, maybe not. At our current precise moment I feel I may never leave this chair. Ever. Like, literally. I might die here. Or, live forever.",
				"There‚Äôs a numbness to this tired mind and body. An awareness rises of holding tension in the shoulders, followed by a deep breath and a release. Shoulders fall. Another breath.",
				"The sound of a commercial plane enters and disrupts the silence. The faint, soft whir is out of sight yet all-enveloping. Soon it passes and we‚Äôre left again with the eternal silence, a vessel and a cradle and a vase and a tomb. And, a frame.",
				"Maybe, I don‚Äôt know, I say, maybe this, right here, maybe this is the actual end.",
				"We wonder awhile and settle into a rhythm of in‚Äìand‚Äìexhales. Chests rising and lowering slowly and gently. We talked a lot on the road and this moment feels like a trophy.",
				"We watch a leaf become detached from one of the overhead trees. It falls with a graceful leisure and then, to our muted surprise, stops mid-air some four feet above the surface of the glowing pool. The dry brown leaf wobbles a bit then starts spinning slowly. We remain unchanged in our outward emotionlessness, chests still steadily rising and falling. Internally, we land on the same thought: this must be some sort of miniature whirlwind otherwise invisible and failing to produce the slightest effect on the surface water of the pool or anywhere else. But then, it becomes evident that instead this is actually one of those small miracles.",
				"We watch for awhile before deciding it‚Äôs time to sleep.",
				"The following morning the leaf was still floating in place, though now completely motionless. Further inspection revealed a thread of spider silk. A miracle of a different sort.",
				"We ease into the chilly pool.",
				"Between us we know it‚Äôs going to be a scorcher today. Over a hundred for the seventh day in a row.",
				"Our mere presence in the pool brings the floating leaf to a slow curved sway, ranking it amongst the most elegant pendulums in all of existence anywhere for the moment anyway, or, maybe ever.",
				"And that‚Äôs how this day began.",
				"Then, more coffee and reading.",
				"Our possibilities for the weeks ahead as we see them are handwritten on a motel map:<br /><br /><strong style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\">Optional Options & Opportunities</strong>",

				"Despite an unspoken desire for a day of rest after the three days on the road, we venture out for a museum we‚Äôve wanted to visit for many years. We leave our possessions in the rental house. My friend and I are eager-bordering-on-antsy for some of the inspiration that we came for.",
				"The museum opens at eleven and we are the first visitors in the doors.",
				"Tickets. Pamphlets. A map.",
				"Art.",
				"Ideas.",
				"I like this a lot, I say, standing before a bus-sized painting.",
				"The galleries quickly fill. It‚Äôs Saturday, afterall.",
				"Human flow.",
				"We take advantage of the benches placed in front of art.",
				"For respite and also for people watching.",
				"Man with chunky glasses enters, raises phone, snaps photo, man exits.",
				"Smart-looking couple enters, walks, stops, walks.",
				"Woman in pastels enters, passes through.",
				"It went on like that for awhile, with a rhythmless cadence‚Äì",
				"That is, until, drum roll: The Crew arrived. Thee. Crew.",
				"The mob. The party. The troupe. Like, an actual troupe.",
				"Five six seven eight, and‚Äì",
				"Run.",
				"The way.",
				"Run, run, The Way.",
				"Runway runaways up and down ablaze.",
				"The mob, the mob, the runaway mob.",
				"The blaze, the gaze, the shoestring brigades.",
				"Amazed by the haze and the craze of the museum maze.",
				"A phase, they said, the mob, the crew, the newest of the new.",
				"Me and you.",
				"A phrase, the praise, the mob, the crew, the old, the young, the sad, the fun.",
				"They passed us by but we followed. Stalked, really. We wanted in. We would find a way. We knew it was possible. Somehow we knew we could do it. We knew it was now. Or never. It was now.",
				"There must have been twelve of them, I initially thought, then I counted. Thirteen.",
				"They wore red, pink, purple with black and white trimming the seams and edges. With occasional very thin yellows and oranges and lime greens. Hearts were everywhere. Drawn in Sharpie, patches sewn, iron-on decals, on shoes and pant legs, arms and shoulders, hats and sunglasses. Tattoos and piercings. Lots of hearts. And, a few small black stars here and there. And circles and scribbles and dots and, if one looked closely, rockets.",
				"There seemed to be no leader.",
				"They were silent.",
				"Some wore simple eye-liner, others heavy makeup, others none. Some were skinny, others solidly built. Gender flowed like the flooded Amazon across and through the electromagnetic spectrum, visibly and otherwise. Individually they were each cool as a cucumber. Together, it was a broadway show in motion. We‚Äôd entered a modern day silent film.",
				"They were zestfully more interesting than the museum and the art but with noses buried in pamphlets and rectangular compositions, ears muffed by audio guides, few, if any of the other museum-goers noticed this spectacle. Which seemed impossible, to us.",
				"We moved in. Closer. We needed more data.",
				"They smelled like roses and burning sage and moved like a mashup of lions and detectives.",
				"That‚Äôs it, I thought, they were on display, consciously performing, living public art. But we needed more. We found our way in. We sauntered closer, moving up on a sculpture at the center of the room where our troupe had gathered for a continuation of their silent considerations.",
				"I‚Äôd been deciding who to approach first and landed on one of the shorter ones. They wore red and purple striped pants and a faded crushed velvet red dinner jacket over a ruffled white tuxedo shirt. Also, giant dark circles in fuchsia frames for sunnies and an afro with two pick combs sticking out the top, one shiny chrome, the other, of course, <span style=\"color: #E34234;\">vermillion</span>.",
				"Excuse me, I whispered, there on the outskirts of their traveling village, I hate to interrupt your flow, but are you at liberty to share the nature of this club?",
				"Silence. Nothing. No acknowledgment.",
				"Hello?",
				"I reached out to tap the shoulder but my finger passed through.",
				"A ghost troupe.",
				"That explains why no one else was seeing this, we realized, my friend and I.",
				"We looked at each other, raised our eyebrows.",
				"This plot has both thinned and thickened, we thought.",
				"One of the others circled around to us with a tractor beam of laser eye contact.",
				"Hey, I‚Äôm Bozo84. We‚Äôre a nomadic curatorial team, they said with a wry smirk. We produce shows across a variety of other realms, dimensions, timeframes, heavens, hells, everything in between.",
				"We respond with nods, fakingly taking it in stride. I realize we may have just been given the opportunity to attend to the tenth optional option on our list for this vacation.",
				"What are you called? I ask.",
				"The Valentine Mob. Would you like to join us for the afternoon? Maybe dinner later?",
				"Yes, we say and nod in response without hesitation.",
				"A moment later we‚Äôre in new rose-colored outfits. Form-fitting purples and pinks and sashes and shades.",
				"We‚Äôve seen all we need to see, Bozo84 shares, and we follow our new friends‚Äìeffortlessly through walls, we‚Äôre also invisible now‚Äìto the exit.",
				"Outside we convene with our mob.",
				"Introductions! Declares Bozo84.",
				"Hello, I‚Äôm Keystone007.",
				"And I‚Äôm Chaplinüíú.",
				"I go by Busterüóù.",
				"Greetings, my name is Lucilleüé±.",
				"Bubbles, says the shortest one in the group.",
				"Dink7000, says the tallest.",
				"I‚Äôm Patches, said a sad-faced figure with a bow of the head and a tip of a plum colored velvet top hat.",
				"We‚Äôre Binky, Buggy, and Buttons, said three young ladies who were clearly triplets.",
				"Cocoü¶ä, quipped with a nod.",
				"And I am the leader of this ragtag mob of love and truth, the Purple Panther aka InspectorC. Welcome. We give temporary free passes only very occasionally. The vote on you was favorable. You have three days with us, your time. You may participate as you wish, we have no rules. That said, if for any reason we feel it necessary to send you back to your vacation, we will do so with the snap of the fingers. < They all snap > Currently, we are focused on a handful of projects with simultaneous strategic development and implementation. Curatorial efforts, mainly, putting out fires, starting new ones, but we also enjoy your run-of-the-mill good old fashioned standardized exploring, among various other side ventures and activities, eccentric or otherwise.",
				"All thirteen looked upon us now. Our turn.",
				"To their kind satisfaction, we went about our introductions with slightly less brevity than their collectively succinct roll call. But not much less. We only shared that which we deemed necessary. No more. No less.",
				"Excellent. Onward, declared the Purple Panther.",
				"A giant <span style=\"color: #FC0FC0;\">pink</span> and chrome-striped surfboard appeared from nowhere and the mob stepped on without skipping a beat. We followed. And, off we went into what seemed to be‚Äìas someone who‚Äôd never been out in it might say‚Äìthe cosmos.",
				"Feeling a bit unsure of things, for the first time, we shuffled to the back of the pack on the glider, wondering what we‚Äôd gotten ourselves into. Had we died?",
				"Lucilleüé± noticed our disquiet and appeared from the group, now sitting cross-legged next to us and mimingly inviting us to join. We happily accepted.",
				"She ceased miming and soothingly talked us down.",
				"We thanked her. It was, it turned out, as she comforted us back to acceptable levels of security, all good. It was as if she had a magic eraser of anxiety with only the tone of her voice.",
				"And then we swooped into a paisley portal and found ourselves hovering above the roof of a skyscraper in a large city that neither of us knew. The buildings were taller and narrower than any place we‚Äôd ever been or seen. Not a cloud in the sky. Warm, maybe eighty degrees. And silent, there above the city.",
				"We followed the Valentine Mob onto the roof and marched up to the edge. They grasped hands and stepped off one at a time and we just went right along, answering the age old question, If all your friends jumped off a building would you follow them?",
				"Our freefalling party fanned out on a curve, dropped what seemed like fifty or sixty stories and then swooped right into a tall open window, still some hundred stories up from the street far below.",
				"Ah, InspectorC, right on time. You‚Äôve got the whole gang, wonderful. Plus two I see, always generous with your guest passes, how lovely.",
				"InspectorC hands the woman an envelope. She immediately passes it off to an assistant then tosses what seems to be a thumb drive to Bubbles. This is followed by our abrupt exit, single file back out the window onto the steady surfboard, and, as before, off we went.",
				"You might wonder why we don‚Äôt share these files up in the cloud across wireless space, says the Purple Panther.",
				"I was, I say.",
				"Yeah, it‚Äôs for security, they say.",
				"I nod.",
				"Then, Cocoü¶ä yells out, ‚ÄúFive six seven eight,‚Äù and the whole mob breaks into song there on the surfboard as we cruise back up and into and across this cosmos.",
				"The song was the soundtrack for the following b roll: three days of swooping in, picking up art, launching away, galleries housed in futuristic architecture beyond anything we could imagine, as though they owned and operated on entire planets, some of them floating in the sky, another under an ocean. Then there were the restaurants. Bonkers. It was all very sci fi. And the two parties we went to. Beyond. We got to know the crew pretty well, most of them. They gave us new and improved outfits every time they changed, which was often.",
				"You‚Äôre one of us now, said Lucilleüé±, which made us feel fantastic.",
				"As the song wound down, our b-roll ended with a literal descent of the cruiser, and my friend and I returning to our Air B-n-B, poolside.",
				"Perhaps we‚Äôll see you again, said The Purple Panther, you never know. The Valentine Mob blasted back up into the sky, the song faded out and we stood there in shock, a return to the silence.",
				"We could have and would have and maybe should have just stayed with them forever, we agreed. But, our time was up. We had to accept it. Alas, we were only temporary guests."

				"Back inside, the collective hum of the air conditioner and three ceiling fans was a murmuring whir rustling us from the blur.",

				"Ommm, what just happened? I say.",
				"Right? My friend says.",
				"We soon arrived at the same conclusion: coffee.",
				"What to even say?",
				"Off to a good start, I finally comment, referring to the vacation in general.",

				"My friend shakes their head.",
				"We are changed people for the better I do believe. It would seem our list of optional options remains satisfactory for now anyway. Yeah?",
				"Yeah, says my friend.",
				"I refill our mugs and we transition our respective micro climates and geographies from cool-kitchen to warm-bordering-on-already-humid poolside.",
				"The floating leaf is now gone.",
				"What a suspension, I think, of disbelief; this, all is.",
				"The pool feels like an old friend already. The way swimming pools often can.",
				"I tap my toe on the surface and send a ripple across to the other side.",
				"My friend audibly inhales and then exhales a comforting Ahh-Ommmmmm. Revitalization, restoration, recognition of the re-edification.",
				"I thoroughly enjoy the solace and our new kaleidoscopic memories.",
				"Moments after the pool surface returned to perfect stillness, though we knew we could contentedly sit here all day, we instead decide to gather up ourselves and take this relaxation train to the boardwalk, and beach, and whatever little shopping areas we might happen upon.",
				"Back in the familiar car. It had been three days that felt more like three weeks or months.",
				"The map points the way, phone on dash. My friend pulls out our list of optional options and adds, ‚Äúmaps‚Äù to the acceptably exceptional use cases of technology on this vacation. I nod in agreement and follow the line.",
				"Before long and without rage we arrive.",
				"It‚Äôs already noon.",
				"I park and we stroll.",
				"The boardwalk and the beach stretch out before us and under us.",
				"A spectacle of spirits and space.",
				"Sea and sand and sorcerers.",
				"Sauces on tacos and a saxophone seeking a salary of silver.",
				"Waves. Landing. Frequencies across lengths of space and time.",
				"The sand in sandals feels like a final evidentiary sensation proving our arrival. At the beach. A castle-less spread of granular topology underfoot, under ocean, together with sky, bounding light and atmosphere.",
				"Lunch? I say.",
				"Definitely, my friend says.",
				"We find food and a table with a view of everything.",
				"We hardly ate for three days, I say.",
				"It was all cheese and champagne, my friend responds.",
				"Right, right, and tea.",
				"Lazy days are rarely vessels for wildly broad ranges of unpredictable outcomes.",
				"But, you never know, do you?",
				"How open are you?",
				"How available are you to the fountain?",
				"Of possibilities and improbabilities.",
				"Peaks peaking and speaking in percussive dotted points like Braille beats.",
				"Listen. Breathe. Sway. Turn. Stretch.",
				"A woman carrying a surfboard floats by on roller skates. We gaze and remember.",
				"We enjoy our lunch.",
				"There is an absence of urgency. A verifiable void of vascular vexation.",
				"Robust palm trees line the boardwalk up and down the beach. They capture my full attention. I‚Äôm there for them. It‚Äôs not the other way around. My friend notices.",
				"Whenever I‚Äôm around palm trees I think I need to be living in a place with palm trees, my friend says.",
				"Yeah same, I say.",
				"This vibe, the colors, this air, the warm sun, flamingos, these trees, my friend says.",
				"Totally, I say, adding nothing more to the list, though I could.",
				"So how do we make sense of the last three days with The Valentine Mob? My friend asks.",
				"Do we need to? I wonder aloud. Can we? Is it even possible?",
				"Maybe not, says my friend, but maybe so?",
				"Let‚Äôs walk, I say, and we do.",
				"After a few boardwalk blocks we happened upon a bookstore a few doors inland. Our first in town. In we went.",
				"A bell rang as the door closed behind us. The place was empty aside from the clerk who looked up now.",
				"Finally, they said.",
				"Yes, here we are, I say.",
				"They couldn‚Äôt wait any longer, says the clerk.",
				"They?",
				"After an hour of poking around someone by the name of Binky got impatient and left but not before asking me to pass along a note to the two of you. The clerk handed us a slip of paper.",
				"Stay here. We broke something",
				"Huh, says my friend, you don‚Äôt say.",
				"Binky is one interesting character, said the clerk. Are you in some sort of trouble?",
				"No no, I say, no trouble, I‚Äôm sure we won‚Äôt be long.",
				"We started browsing the aisles and shelves and titles and words and covers and spines.",
				"Mystery, that‚Äôs where we both landed and dug in.",
				"I found one that grabbed me and took a seat on the floor.",
				"The crime took place at a motel. A robbery at midnight, notably humid. The owner suspected the bellhop. The bellhop suspected a particular hotel guest who had seemed sketch. On account of a prior record of robbery, albeit a decade in the past, the detective suspected the owner. It was all very suspect. Dialogue driven. The wallpaper in the 1970s-style questioning room was plaid patterns of <span style=\"color: #6B8E23;\">olive drab</span> and <span style=\"color: #826644;\">raw umber</span> and <span style=\"color: #F28500;\">tangerine</span> on <span style=\"color: #EDEAE0;\">darkened alabaster</span>. The floors were wood. The air conditioner was broken. In the middle of questioning the hotel guest, the bellhop broke into the room, Come quick, Room 1513, there‚Äôs been a‚Äì",
				"There you are, said Binky, looking down at the two of us.",
				"We stood.",
				"I hate to pull you away from your vacation but you must come with me. Now.",
				"My friend and I looked at each other, then said in unison, What‚Äôs this all about?",
				"I‚Äôll tell you on the way, come on. Binky grabbed my wrist and pulled me out onto the sidewalk, but not before I dropped a twenty on the counter for the book which was small enough to slip into the back pocket of my pants.",
				"Into the van! Yelled Binky.",
				"My friend got in the front seat.",
				"Is this a hotel van? I asked.",
				"Yes, do you like it? I had to steal it.",
				"I love it, said my friend, but where‚Äôs the crew and the surfboard and everything?",
				"The Mob, said Binky, we‚Äôre a Mob, The Mob. With a capital T and a capital M.",
				"Where‚Äôs The Mob? Asked my friend, overly articulating the words The Mob.",
				"I‚Äôll tell you everything. What took you so long? You were late to the bookstore! I waited for. Ev. Errrrr.",
				"Neither my friend nor I responded.",
				"You were supposed to be there an hour ago according to our records.",
				"We had lunch along the boardwalk? I said, And took our time?",
				"I‚Äôll say, said Binky, no worries. But, something is off.",
				"Binky sped through traffic.",
				"So, get this, we‚Äôre prepping for our next big show which is a whole thing and we open one of the trunks we picked up when you were with us actually, and there it was, the surprise thing. UNaccounted for. InspectorC was freakin OUT, closed the lid. It‚Äôs a trap, he was yelling. He picked up the trunk, grabbed Dink7000, they ran to the limo and away they went. Gone. Like, gone gone. Poof. Left us standin. We just kept working, things like this DO happen sometimes, especially just before shows open. But, I mean, not really actually like THIS like actually, you know? We put two and two together and when we picked up that piece we had you with us.",
				"Continuing speedily along a stretch of industrial highway, Binky held up their phone, Do you remember this trunk?",
				"I do, said my friend, that was the one Dink7000 seemed to steal? But no one said anything, that was weird.",
				"Right, said Binky, exactly. You COULD have said SOMETHING! Dink STOLE that shit. We don‚Äôt steal, let me repeat, we DO NOT steal shit. So yeah THEN on top of that shit we broke something. While unpacking. We have to return it. To the artist. Thee. Artist. And HOPE they have a replacement. Or can FIX it. Or some shit.",
				"The artist, I said, where are they? And why do you need us?",
				"Are you with us? Asked Binky.",
				"Yes! Of course! Yelled my friend while slapping the dashboard. Let‚Äôs fix this situation!",
				"My friend looked back with a gleam in their eye.",

				"I held the cube and not only continued to hear the noise of the broken art, faint as it was, but there was also a subtle vibration that felt like it might have been growing stronger. Perhaps becoming more broken, it seemed.",
				"I turned the slick bright cube over in my hands and was surprised to find a small button that hitherto, on account of it being seamlessly integrated into the surface, I‚Äôd failed to notice.",
				"I wonder what this does? I said, pressing it.",
				"The cube opened like a book, the inside faces glowed.",
				"Is everything glowing everywhere? I said in frustration with myself. I‚Äôd clearly tapped the catalyst for what was about to become a series of actions that were probably best left un-action‚Äôd.",
				"The once-faint sound now grew to audible for all present on the limo.",
				"What have you done? Yelled Binky. Set it down! Close it!",
				"Dropping to a seated position I held the broken, humming art in my hands and tried to close it but to no avail.",
				"It won‚Äôt close.",
				"Yeah, it‚Äôs, you know, broken, said Binky. Sheeeeee-it.",
				"My friend made one of those faces with their mouth where their lips on one side went down and sideways pushing their cheeks out into a circular puff so as to communicate, Yikes.",
				"Binky dropped next to me and took possession of the art.",
				"The vibrating hum grew. And grew.",
				"Within a few moments it started to feel like sound from other places, other harmonious hums and drones and monotone tones were emerging, across space and‚Äìit seemed‚Äìtime, connecting to this opened broken box. It was like one of those glass plasma balls that you hold in your hands and the light extends from the center to the edges where your hands are touching, only we were now in the middle holding the glowing command center of where things originate. We were the hub.",
				"The sound grew. There was a complexity in the additive layers but the structure of the sound paradoxically expressed a pure and perfectable simplicity. Perfectable because that was what it seemed to be doing as it grew, becoming more and more perfect, like filling in all the points of the circumference of a circle, approaching infinity. It had a long way to go, but that didn‚Äôt take away from the ever-increasing and accelerating completingness.",
				"So, perhaps before we made our quick exit I should have told you just a little bit about The Artist, and I definitely should have been the handler of the art. My apologies, said Binky, the glowing, intricately humming opened cube still in their lap.",
				"A warbling whir emerged as the sound evolved, the seed of a rhythm, perhaps, I thought.",
				"Then, Binky handed it back to me, and the cracked cube stayed steady in my hands and continued to evolve for the remainder of our commute.",
				"The ride was thirty minutes in duration. Longer than usual, said Binky.",
				"The Artist lives on a pretty remote planet. They moved there from Earth, actually, maybe ten years ago.",
				"Entering the atmosphere we bounced around a bit, something we were accustomed to by now, but finally landed like a feather on a pillow.",
				"Through the windows we observed a green landscape, and your run-of-the-mill floating chunks of rock up in the clouds, waterfalls flowing off them into the rain clouds below.",
				"This place is wet. Lotsa water, said Binky. The Artist has a studio underground, let‚Äôs hope they‚Äôre here. Dropping in on, well, anyone these days is not exactly what we‚Äôd call customary.",
				"Binky sent a message, it seemed, by tapping their knuckle. A moment later a large circular hole opened in the grass just next to the limo. Down we went. A spiral staircase escalator took us down maybe fifty feet and from there we entered an elevator, and further down we went. Moments later the door slid open to a vast space with a variety of compartmentalized areas, all seemingly dedicated to one glowing art project after another. The wide variety of the objects that could be seen from the elevator was striking, in terms of size and shape, but they all had one thing in common: the glow.",
				"Gliding in on a drone umbrella, illuminated of course, The Artist wore purple velvet pants, tall yellow boots, and a SUB POP t-shirt under a perfectly distressed and form fitting denim jacket. Long hair, unshaven, lean and lanky, a cigarette in one hand, black sunglasses that came off as‚Äã‚Äã The Artist touched down and went into the breast pocket of the jacket. This was either a well-rehearsed welcoming entrance, or, well, rehearsed or not this was one cool cat.",
				"Unorthodox, said The Artist.",
				"The visit? Said Binky, Yes, yes, I guess so.",
				"I like it, said The Artist, come in. I‚Äôll show you around.",
				"A hover droid with drinks on a platter arrived as we started following The Artist.",
				"I took a tall, thin flute with effervescent <span style=\"color: #E6E6FA;\">lavender</span> champagne I was guessing. Glowing, of course.",
				"My friend chose the <span style=\"color: #CCCCFF;\">periwinkle</span> option, complete with a blackberry, also aglow.",
				"And who are your friends? Asked The Artist, halting our parade, turning one-eighty, and now staring at my friend and me.",
				"These are our interns, said Binky.",
				"Welcome interns. The Artist turned again and continued walking, leading us across the vast floor of what felt like three or more massive airplane hangers.",
				"So, said Binky.",
				"Let‚Äôs chat in the parlor, we‚Äôre almost there, said The Artist.",
				"We walked in silence for awhile, left the open space into a corridor that snaked into a network of small studios, work spaces, dens, closets, rooms. One elevator up, out into a cave, another elevator down, and then, Ah, the parlor, finally, said The Artist. My apologies for the journey it takes to get here, but I needed a break and this is the place. For that, for the break. Have a seat.",
				"Our nearly empty flutes were replaced.",
				"Are you hungry? How does ramen sound? Said The Artist.",
				"Thank you very much, said Binky, but we are in a bit of a‚Äì",
				"I‚Äôd love some ramen, said my friend.",
				"Same, said The Artist, I like this intern.",
				"Large bowls of steaming ramen rolled in on trays.",
				"So Binks, what. Is. Up? So good to see you. And, as I said, so unorthodox. The gallery would not be happy. Probably. Who knows.",
				"Yeah, here‚Äôs the thing. We managed to, somehow, ommm‚Ä¶",
				"Your art broke, said my friend, inspiring an uncharacteristic snarl from Binky.",
				"Broke? Wild! Did you bring it?",
				"I pulled the cube from the satchel and placed it on the coffee table between us all.",
				"Hello old friend, said The Artist, running their finger along the crack and smiling.",
				"Binky was visibly tense, their shoulders were even raised in anticipation of an oncoming verbal assault.",
				"But it was not to come. The Artist looked up inquisitively, chopsticks and ramen and champagne and tea and sushi and soy sauce all akimbo. There was nothing particularly splayed or, or, or askew or awkward the way the word ‚Äòakimbo‚Äô usually describes things. Still, akimbo was the precise descriptor.",
				"Akim-bo.",
				"A prelude. Thee. Pray. Lewd.",
				"Shrewd.",
				"Ahem, dude?",
				"Patient anticipation waiting for an explanation‚Äì",
				"Prescient prolongification deciding on a quick vacation‚Äì",
				"Destination‚Äì",
				"Transformation‚Äì",
				"Instantiation‚Äì",
				"Of lesser known What‚Äôre They Gonna Say‚Äôs?",
				"Is this unintentional praise? Thought The Artist.",
				"Or sideways malaise?",
				"Blues gone grays?",
				"A rattling of a tray (the silence causing anxiety in the hovering droid).",
				"A finding of‚Äì",
				"The Way? (Refrain, repeat 3x)",
				"I‚Äôm confused. You think it‚Äôs broken? Asked The Artist.",
				"Binky tilted their head, startled at the absence of the expected inferno of berating screams.",
				"But, the crack, said my friend.",
				"The Artist belted into laughter, Y‚Äôall came alllllll the way here. They started snapping pics of the cracked cube. Amazing.",
				"My friend slurped up a spoonful of ramen.",
				"So, it‚Äôs not broken? I asked.",
				"Of course not, said The Artist, the crack is the broken seal, as planned. It means it‚Äôs working. The seedlings are sprouting and the tiny roots are taking hold. Down deep in the fold. Did Natasha tell you nothing?",
				"We did receive extensive written documentation, said Binky, but we assumed the crack meant it broke.",
				"I am sooo glad to see you my little friend, said The Artist, patting the top surface of the cube. I thought I was going to have to wait weeks for the opening! Now I want to keep you here with me forever! Stupidly I only made one.",
				"The hum and whir we‚Äôd heard had silenced when we arrived, but it started back up again now, pulsating with a rhythmic glow.",
				"Did you see the title? Asked The Artist.",
				"With their answer, Ahem, no, Binky returned to the expectation they‚Äôd had, that of a nasty reprimand.",
				"Ok, all good, said The Artist. Not to worry.",
				"The Artist opened the cube as I had, like a book, but this time slid upward a panel on the right side, revealing a screen.",
				"Legible words appeared, The Ambient Novel.",
				"You see? Said The Artist, I planted a seed and this thing is growing. In time we will have a complete piece, but it‚Äôs still going to take awhile. There‚Äôs a variety of processes happening now, basically mimicking organic growth. Bio-mimicry, as they started calling it back in the 90s or whatever.",
				"Ok, ok, said Binky, our mistake.",
				"How long will it take? Asked my friend, further spooning ramen broth into their mouth.",
				"Maybe another hour? Said The Artist.",
				"Cool, I said.",
				"Yeah, right? Cool, said The Artist. Say, why don‚Äôt you wait and we‚Äôll take it in together. I‚Äôd love that! I really wanted to experience a prototype before shipping this thing, but there was simply no time. Now I‚Äôll get to experience it too! Finally!",
				"Binky was so relieved at the resolution and disaster-dodge, they agreed immediately.",
				"Excellent. I need a nap, said The Artist. Feel free to wander the studio, just please don‚Äôt touch anything, and no photos. You understand.",
				"My friend, Binky and I went about our wandering. In all our prior trips with The Valentine Mob we were only along on what amounted to courier expeditions and planning meetings. Dropping in and popping out, mish mash wham bang. Saw all that futuristic amazements of architectural wonder, but this was next level. That was the macro, this was the micro. The nuts and bolts of the interior workings and manifestations of The Art. We had one hour.",
				"We observed a panoply of diverse miracles. It was wild. Every color, gear, hidden tech, exposed tech, exploded mechanics, imploded and gigantic, but also, small. Like I said, it was wild.",
				"But, our hour flew by and what seemed like an instant later, we returned to the parlor.",
				"The Artist entered, outfit change. Oversized puffy pajamas, splashy-shaped patterns dominated by shades of light <span style=\"color: #E0FFFF;\">cyan</span> and <span style=\"color: #DF00FF;\">phlox</span>, and still with the sunglasses.",
				"The round coffee table held large stainless steel bowls overflowing with caramel corn. Also, cans of soda in ice. The lights dimmed.",
				"The Artist leaned in smiling, gazing at the screen, Ready?",
				"Ah yeah, said my friend.",
				"Let‚Äôs do this, I said.",
				"Binky nodded.",
				"The Artist tapped the PLAY button and sat back.",
				"Now published in both print, digital and audio forms across countless editions and narrated by dozens of actors and other media personalities, the inspiration for countless motion pictures, we had the good fortune to experience the very first emanation from the fountain that is‚Äì"
