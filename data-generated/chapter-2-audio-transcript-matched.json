The Lost Resort, said Binky, that’s what we call it, come on. Parked and into the lobby. Binky tossed the keys to the clerk, Sorry about that. Yeah, not cool, said the clerk. Binky slapped a hundred on the counter. The clerk nodded, Ok, fine. We three flowed through into the hall and up some stairs. The place was wrecked.",

So weird, said Binky. Into the room we were met with a small wrinkly mauve tent and immediately in we went. The interior opened up to an impossibly massive space, clearly altogether another place.

Of course we can’t use broken works. And we can’t fix it. The Artist will not be happy, they said. They needs to keep working here, but yous and me can go take care of this shit, said Binky.
